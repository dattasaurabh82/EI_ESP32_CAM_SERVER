## What is this?

This educational tool helps reduce the time needed for capturing and labeling ESP32 camera images for TinyML training in [edgeimpulse](https://docs.edgeimpulse.com/reference). It's more efficient than the standard method of capturing and uploading single images through the [edgeimpulse data forwarder firmware](https://github.com/edgeimpulse/firmware-espressif-esp32).

Instead, it creates an MJPEG stream directly from the camera and displays it on a camera-hosted frontend. This allows you to capture, label, and bulk upload images to the edgeimpulse studio‚Äîmaking the process more efficient than sitting there for a long time doing it manually.

## ToDo - WIP

- [x] Stabilize Stream
- [x] Optimize Capture frame
- [x] Integrate edge impulse upload API
- [x] Button to Start Stop Stream But still retain snapshot (currently it's always streaming)
- [x] Add button and counter option for automatic capture at certain delays
- [x] Persistant saving of EI config in LittleFS.
- [x] Check detecting a Project's `Set Labelling Method`](https://forum.edgeimpulse.com/t/is-there-an-api-end-point-to-get-projects-set-labelling-method/13292?u=dattasaurabh82) and set it correctly for image upload
- [x] Beautify a bit
- [x] Add Footer
- [x] Implement actions for compilation checks in Github Actions
- [x] Update Readme and Documentation
- [ ] Feature (Optional): If not connected to wifi, first load captive portal in AP mode
- [ ] Implement gzipped method and transformations for optimizing file storage for frontend

   ## Hardware Setup
  
   Tested on: [XIAO_ESP32S3](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/xiao_esp32s3_getting_started/)

   <br>

   > The XIAO_ESP32S3 gets very hot when streaming MJPEG as stated [here](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/xiao_esp32s3_camera_usage/#project-ii-video-streaming)

   ![alt text](<assets/Screenshot 2025-02-18 at 23.54.35.png>)

   So I added a beefy cooper heat sink used in raspberry PIs and not the cheap aluminium ones and thought maybe I should just give it some air üí®

   ![alt text](<assets/Screenshot 2025-02-18 at 23.56.44.png>)

   __But then how do I put it in as I like things to be organized and in place?__

   So, I designed a cooling contraption for better air flow ...
   And, additionally it holds everything together and also has a modular gorilla arm screw adapter.

   __Before__ turning __ON__ the fans

   __After__ turning __ON__ the fans

   ![alt text](<assets/Screenshot 2025-02-19 at 00.07.25.png>)

   Two points to note here:
   
   1. The OV5640 camera also gets ü•µ.

      ![alt text](<assets/Screenshot 2025-02-19 at 00.13.18.png>)
   
      > !! Plan to fix that in next iteration
   
   2. The fan power is not drawn form the same VBUS that powers the XIAO_ESP32S3 but has a separate source, so that the performance of XIAO_ESP32S3 is not affected.
   
      > Yes that means you need a separate cable if you do not want to fry your XIAO_ESP32S3.

      > My quick & dirty elegant solution

## Software Preparation

Arduino IDE version: `2.3.4`

### Install libraries

1. [ESPAsyncWebServer](https://github.com/ESP32Async/ESPAsyncWebServer)
2. [AsyncTCP](https://github.com/ESP32Async/AsyncTCP)

> You can find them from the Library Manager of IDE. There are various versions. Install ones by "ESP32Async" for both the libraries.

### File upload - for frontend

We need to upload our files (html, css. js, etc. for the frontend) to esp-32 via [arduino-littlefs-upload](https://github.com/earlephilhower/arduino-littlefs-upload)

1. Go to the [releases](https://github.com/earlephilhower/arduino-littlefs-upload/releases) page and click the `.vsix` file to download.
2. Move the file to Plugins Directory

   ```bash
   # Find the .arduinoIDE directory
   cd ~/.arduinoIDE/
   pwd
   # Create plugins dir, if it's not there
   mkdir plugins
   # Copt the files, in my case it was downloaded in Downloads dir
   cd \
   cd Downloads
   cp arduino-littlefs-upload-x.x.x.vsix ~/.arduinoIDE/plugins/
   ```

3. Quit & reopen Arduino IDE. __Note:__ Sometimes you might have to restart the mac
4. Pressing `CMD` + `SHIFT` + `P`, will open commands palette of Arduino IDE
5. Type in `Upload LittleFS` and the full command (`Upload LittleFS to Pico/ESP8266/ESP32`) will show up. Hit `ENTER`
6. All the contents from [`data/`](data/) will not be transferred to the fs of ESP32
   > Make sure Serial Monitor is closed

### Credentials Settings

Copy [credentials.h.template](credentials.h.template) to a new file called `credentials.h` and update it's contents:

```c++
#ifndef CREDENTIALS_H
#define CREDENTIALS_H

const char* ssid = "YOUR_SSID";
const char* password = "YOUR_PWD";

#endif // CREDENTIALS_H
```

Update wifi credentials and your [Edge Impulse API key](https://docs.edgeimpulse.com/reference/edge-impulse-api/edge-impulse-api) (TBD)

### Camera Settings

Pick a esp32 camera module based on the [camera_pins.h](camera_pins.h) and use only one in [camera_init.h](camera_init.h)

```c++
// Define camera model before including camera_pins.h
// e.g.: We are using cheap AI Thinker Cam
#define CAMERA_MODEL_AI_THINKER 1
```

Most of the camera settings doesn't need to be changed but sometimes you may need to flip the camera frame vertically or horizontally. In that case [camera_init.h](camera_init.h) find the section

```c++
 // Additional camera settings after initialization
 sensor_t * s = esp_camera_sensor_get();
 if (s) {
     // Set frame size to desired resolution
     s->set_framesize(s, FRAMESIZE_QQVGA);  // 160x120
     // Flip camera vertically
     s->set_vflip(s, 1);
     // Flip camera horizontally
     // s->set_hmirror(s, 1)
 }
```

### Server Port Settings

Our default web server is on port `80` defined in `WebServer server(80);` in our [EI_ESP32_CAM_SERVER.ino](EI_ESP32_CAM_SERVER.ino)

### Usage

After successful upload, you should see something like this

   <summary> 4 . [BONUS] Testing Github Actions workflow, locally</summary>

### Prerequisites

- Install Docker Desktop for Mac
- Make sure socket is accessible

   ![alt text](<assets/Screenshot 2025-02-19 at 01.00.14.png>)

- Install act using Homebrew:

   ```bash
   brew install act
   ```

### Running Tests

From your project root directory, run:

```bash
act -P ubuntu-latest=ghcr.io/catthehacker/ubuntu:act-latest --container-architecture linux/amd64 -v
```

> Note: The `-v` flag enables verbose output for better debugging.

### Testing Specific Events

Test push event:

```bash
act push
```

Test manual workflow trigger:

```bash
act workflow_dispatch
```

### Troubleshooting

- If you see warnings about Apple M-series chip, ensure you're using the `--container-architecture linux/amd64` flag
- If Docker isn't running, you'll need to start Docker Desktop first
- Use `-v` flag for verbose output when debugging issues
